# HandZone Presentations

This repository contains materials from two presentations I gave during the HandZone workshops, a series of one-hour sessions on statistical methods and real-data analysis, held twice a month. The workshops are organized by the PsicoStat research group and are open to researchers and faculty from the School of Psychology at the University of Padua.

## Causal Inference – March 27th, 2025

- **Title**: *Causal Inference, DAGs and Propensity Scores*
- **Access PDF**: [https://laurasitaunipd.github.io/handzone/causal-inference/causal-inference.pdf](https://laurasitaunipd.github.io/handzone/causal-inference/causal-inference.pdf)
- **Authors**: Marco Tullio Liuzza, Laura Sità

This presentation introduces key concepts of causal inference in psychology using observational data with a focus on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), confounding and collider bias and adjustment strategies including propensity score methods.

## Latent Genetic Factors – October 30th, 2025

- **Title**: *Causal Inference for Latent Genetic Factors Underlying Psychopathology*
- **Access HTML**: [https://laurasitaunipd.github.io/handzone/project/latent-genetic-factors.html](https://laurasitaunipd.github.io/handzone/project/latent-genetic-factors.html)
- **Author**: Laura Sità

This presentation applies causal inference methods to estimate how latent genetic factors differ between individuals with and without a psychological disorder, using high-dimensional genomic data.
