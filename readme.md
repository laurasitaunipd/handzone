# HandZone Presentations

This repository hosts materials related to two research presentations delivered as part of the HandZone project. Each presentation explores key topics in psychological methodology, with a focus on data analysis and causal inference in psychopathology research.

## Causal Inference – March 27th, 2025

- **Title**: *Causal Inference, DAGs and Propensity Scores*
- **Date**: March 27th, 2025
- **Access PDF**: [https://laurasitaunipd.github.io/handzone/causal-inference/causal-inference.pdf](https://laurasitaunipd.github.io/handzone/causal-inference/causal-inference.pdf)
- **Authors**: Marco Tullio Liuzza, Laura Sità

This presentation introduces key concepts of causal inference in psychology using observational data with a focus on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), confounding and collider bias and adjustment strategies including propensity score methods.

## Latent Genetic Factors – October 30th, 2025

- **Title**: *Causal Inference for Latent Genetic Factors Underlying Psychopathology*
- **Date**: October 30th, 2025
- **Access HTML**: [https://laurasitaunipd.github.io/handzone/project/latent-genetic-factors.html](https://laurasitaunipd.github.io/handzone/project/latent-genetic-factors.html)
- **Author**: Laura Sità

This presentation applies causal inference methods to estimate how latent genetic factors differ between individuals with and without a psychological disorder, using high-dimensional genomic data.
