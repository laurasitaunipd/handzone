# HandZone Presentations

This repository hosts materials related to two research presentations delivered as part of the HandZone project. Each presentation explores key topics in psychological methodology, with a focus on data analysis and causal inference in psychopathology research.

## Causal Inference – March 27th, 2025

- **Title**: *Causal Inference in Psychopathology*
- **Date**: March 27th, 2025
- **Access PDF**: [View Presentation](https://laurasitaunipd.github.io/handzone/causal-inference/causal-inference.pdf)

This presentation introduces core principles of causal inference with a special emphasis on applications in psychological science. The talk covers directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), treatment effects, and challenges in modeling complex psychiatric constructs.

## Latent Genetic Factors – October 30th, 2025

- **Title**: *Causal Inference for Latent Genetic Factors Underlying Psychopathology*
- **Date**: October 30th, 2025
- **Access HTML**: [View Presentation](https://laurasitaunipd.github.io/handzone/project/latent-genetic-factors.html)

This talk builds on the previous work by applying causal reasoning to genetically informed models. It introduces methods for identifying latent genetic dimensions and estimating treatment effects in the presence of latent structure.
